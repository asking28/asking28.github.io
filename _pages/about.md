I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. I am working closely with [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) on solving multi-level optimization problems in the field of Machine Learning.

Before this, I gained valuable experience as a research software engineer at Samsung R&D Bangalore. I completed my undergraduate degree (B.Tech) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (B.H.U)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/), Varanasi. During my B.Tech, I focused on the Localization of Mobile Robot Systems under the guidance of [Dr. Sandeep Ghosh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/sghosheee).

I'm passionate about helping others pursue higher education and research interests. I dedicate an hour each week to assist anyone preparing for higher education applications or interested in discussing research topics. Please feel free to reach out to me via email.

## My current research interests include, but are not limited to -

- Multi-level optimization and optimization in general
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning
