ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile! I'm currently immersed in the world of AutoML at Oracle, leveraging my expertise in Computer Science and Engineering, which I honed during my Master's journey at the University of California, San Diego.  I worked closely with [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) on solving multi-level optimization problems in the field of Machine Learning.

Before my Oracle venture, I had the privilege of being a part of Samsung R&D Bangalore as a research software engineer. During this phase, I gained invaluable experience that enriched my professional journey.

My academic foundation is rooted in a Bachelor's degree (B.Tech) from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee) at the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology (B.H.U)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/), Varanasi. My undergraduate research was centered around the intriguing domain of Mobile Robot System Localization, under the guidance of the accomplished [Dr. Sandeep Ghosh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/sghosheee)..

Beyond my daily work, I'm truly passionate about guiding and assisting others in their pursuit of higher education and research aspirations. 


## My current research interests include, but are not limited to -

- Multi-level optimization and optimization in general
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning
